## Introduction

*This is my OOP Lab Class Workspace Folder*
You'll find all the Programs written **during** the Lab class in this folder/workspace.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three folders, where:

- `src` folder to maintain sources.
- `lib` folder to maintain dependencies.
- The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

Details on dependencies can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
